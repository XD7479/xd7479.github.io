I am a first-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at Johns Hopkins University, where I'm fortunate to be advised by Bloomberg Distinguished Professor <a href="https://cogsci.jhu.edu/directory/alan-yuille">Alan Yuille</a>. 

Before this, I received my B.Eng. degree from Tongji University in 2021. I have also spent great time at ByteDance and NIO.

My research interests currently lie in the field of semi-/weakly-supervised learning and robustness in computer vision.

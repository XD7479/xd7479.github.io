I am a fourth-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at Johns Hopkins University, where I'm fortunate to be advised by Bloomberg Distinguished Professor <a href="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ayuille/">Alan Yuille</a>. I'm currently also a student researcher in Google XR team.

Before this, I received my B.Eng. degree from Tongji University in 2021. I have also spent great time at NIO, ByteDance and Amazon.

My research interests currently lie in the field of vision-and-language learning and 3D understanding & generation.

abstract: "Part segmentations provide a rich and detailed part-level description of objects. However, their annotation requires an enormous amount of work, which makes it difficult to apply standard deep learning methods. In this paper, we propose the idea of learning part segmentation through unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) from synthetic data. We first introduce UDA-Part, a comprehensive part segmentation dataset for vehicles that can serve as an adequate benchmark for UDA. In UDA-Part, we label parts on 3D CAD models which enables us to generate a large set of annotated synthetic images. We also annotate parts on a number of real images to provide a real test set. Secondly, to advance the adaptation of part models trained from the synthetic data to the real images, we introduce a new UDA algorithm that leverages the object's spatial structure to guide the adaptation process. Our experimental results on two real test datasets confirm the superiority of our approach over existing works, and demonstrate the promise of learning part segmentation for general objects from synthetic data. We believe our dataset provides a rich testbed to study UDA for part segmentation and will help to significantly push forward research in this area."
